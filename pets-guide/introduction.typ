= Introduction

This manual covers data reduction using #PETS for NTNU-specific equipment, and lightly touches structure solution.
For structure refinement we refer to the previous manual whose original version is available openly in #cite(<teien>, supplement: "Appendix A.3").
An updated version is available
// in the private repository https://github.com/TEM-Gemini-Centre/developments.
