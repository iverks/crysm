= Introduction

This manual covers data reduction using #PETS for NTNU-specific equipment, and lightly touches on structure solution using SHELX.
For structure refinement we refer to the previous manual whose original version is available openly in #cite(<teien>, supplement: "Appendix A.3").
An updated version is available
// in the private repository https://github.com/TEM-Gemini-Centre/developments.

For access to this private repository contact Emil F. Christiansen, NTNU Department of Physics.
For data acquisition using Instamatic at the TGS/NorTEM JEOL at NTNU, see the manual on acquisition made by Oskar Ryggetangen.
